# JPA Hibernate Advanced Mappings Demo

This project is a **JPA-Hibernate Advanced Mappings Demo** that demonstrates how to establish different types of relationships between database tables using **Hibernate and JPA**. The project uses **MySQL** as the relational database and implements **One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many** relationships.

## Key Features

- **One-to-One Relationship** – Maps a one-to-one association between entities.
- **One-to-Many & Many-to-One Relationship** – Establishes a hierarchical data structure with foreign key constraints.
- **Many-to-Many Relationship** – Demonstrates how multiple entities relate to multiple other entities.
- **Cascade Operations** – Implements cascading behaviors such as persist, remove, merge, and refresh.
- **Lazy & Eager Fetching** – Configures fetching strategies for optimized data retrieval.
- **Bidirectional & Unidirectional Mappings** – Shows both ways to define entity relationships.
- **MySQL Integration** – Uses MySQL as the primary database engine.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21** – Core language for development.
- **Spring Boot** – Framework for simplifying JPA configuration.
- **Hibernate** – ORM framework for database interactions.
- **Spring Data JPA** – Abstraction over Hibernate for easy repository management.
- **MySQL** – Relational database for storing entities.
- **Maven** – Dependency management.
